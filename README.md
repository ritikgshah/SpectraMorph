## 📁 Repository Structure

### 🔸 CSV Files with Metrics

- Organized into subfolders by synthetic HSI dataset:
  - *Botswana*
  - *Kennedy Space Center*
  - *Pavia Center*
  - *Pavia University*
  - *Washington DC Mall*
- Each subfolder contains:
  - CSVs with image quality metrics across various experimental configurations (e.g., different PSFs, downsampling ratios, and MSI band counts).
  - An Excel summary: `All SOTA methods comparison.xlsx` aggregates all individual method metrics and comparison tables
    - Includes the sheet `'Individual metrics analysis'`, which:
      - Shows how often each method achieves the best metric per dataset.
      - Summarizes performance trends and strengths of different methods.

### 🔸 Comparison Implementations

Benchmarks against state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised baselines.

- **Supervised**  
  - Pre-executed Jupyter notebooks for: `FeINFN`, `FusFormer`, `GuidedNet`, `MIMO-SST`
  - Applied to both synthetic datasets and the University of Houston dataset.

- **Unsupervised**  
  - Pre-executed Jupyter notebooks for: `MIAE`, `C2FF`, `SSSR`, `SDP`
  - Applied to both synthetic datasets and the University of Houston dataset.

### 🔸 SpectraLift Implementation
  > Note: The Spectral Inversion Network (SIN) mentioned in the paper is called SpectralSR_MLP in the code on this repository. 

- **SpectraLift Implementation** (`Spectralift_Implementation_Jupyter_Notebooks`):  
  Pre-executed notebooks demonstrating SpectraLift on both synthetic and University of Houston datasets.

- **Ablation Study** (`Spectralift_Ablation_Study_Jupyter_Notebooks`):  
  Pre-executed notebooks evaluating contributions of different model components and architectural choices.

- **Python Scripts** (`SpectraLift_python`):  
  Full Python-based implementation for use in IDEs or via command line.  
  Detailed instructions available in [Python Implementation Details](py_implementation.md).

- **Visualization Notebooks** (`Super_Resolved_Images_Comparison_Jupyter_Notebooks`):  
  Pre-executed notebooks for visual comparison of high-resolution HSI outputs of all methods on each dataset. Includes:
  - Spectral plots
  - Image visualizations
  > Note: Botswana output is split across two notebooks due to data size.

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

Use either `pip` or `conda` to recreate the project environment:

### Using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Using Conda:
```bash
conda env create -f spectralift-env.yaml
conda activate spectralift-env
```
In rare cases, the Conda YAML file may fail to recreate the environment correctly. If so, use requirements.txt.

## 🗂️ Datasets

The repository includes `.mat` files for all synthetic hyperspectral image (HSI) datasets used in our experiments:

- Washington DC Mall  
- Kennedy Space Center  
- Pavia University  
- Pavia Center  
- Botswana  

### 📥 University of Houston Dataset

The full University of Houston dataset can be downloaded from the official source:

## ✅ Reproducibility

To ensure full transparency and ease of experimentation:

- All notebooks are **pre-executed**, so results can be viewed immediately without re-running code.
- Environment files are provided to replicate the exact Python environment used in our experiments.
- Python scripts are included along with detailed instructions to ensure that researchers can use our method with ease.
